                        Hello and welcome to my portfolio.
                        <br> I’m Thibaud Bergez-Vigneau, I’m 19, and on this page you will find information about
                        multiple programming related projects of mine, some finished, some in progress.
                        <br> In my free time I like to listen to music, especially stuff like experimental electronic
                        music. I go to the flea-market early in the morning to find interesting old electronic
                        equipment, cassettes or vinyl.
                        <br> I also like to write code related to images and music, and I plan to make a program that
                        can create generative music, as well as a music visualizer.
                        <br> I speak French, English and Spanish, which allows me to communicate rather easily with
                        people from other countries.
                        <br> In the future I plan to continue making side projects related to images and music, in
                        languages I don’t know yet, like C++ or Rust, if they are suited for the projects.

                    <p>
                        I am currently a second year student at the IUT de Bordeaux in France, in the Computer Science
                        department.
                        <br> Before that I went to Saint-Genès La Salle High School in Bordeaux, where I took
                        Mathematics and Computer Science (NSI, Numérique et Sciences de l’Informatique) as principal
                        subjects.
                        <br> During the last year I took the “Advanced Mathematics” option to strengthen my mathematical
                        knowledge and feed my curiosity. I was part of the “European Class”, which had added English
                        classes.
                        <br> Following this, I chose to take part in the International Track option of the BUT
                        Informatique, with the goal of doing one or multiple internships abroad.
